## üîß TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Dashboard runs entirely in browser (no server needed)
- Data stored locally in each user's browser
- Admin updates won't sync automatically between users
- For true real-time sync, need cloud database (more complex)

## üí° RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
For your use case, I recommend **Method 1 (File Sharing)**:
- Simple to set up
- No technical knowledge needed
- Works on company networks
- Full control over access
